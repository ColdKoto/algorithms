1.) Source code is code made to carry out a specific task as an executable.

2.) Computers are 'smart' because they can carry out lots of tasks faster than
people can. For example listing off all prime numbers up to 1 million.

3.) Programming languages exist to make programming easier and more efficient.
Machine code is difficult to read and write.

4.) Python, Javascript, Java. Many languages exist because some languages are
tailored to make specific programming tasks easier. R is a data science language.

5.) A variable is data saved to a name. Variables are useful because you may
store and manipulate data within a named location.

6.) Single equals assigns data to a variable. Double equals compares 2 pieces of
data and returns a boolean.

7.) Double equals will return true when comparing 10 with '10'. However for
triple equals to return true, they would have to be 10 and 10, or exactly the
same.

8.) The developer console exists to make debugging code easier. You can add
break points and slowly 'jump' from line to line to find any errors.

9.) Conditional statements are statements written so that when they are true,
some code will run. These are commonly if else statements.

EX:

 if(6 > 7){
   console.log('Bad math');
 }
 else{
   console.log('sanity!');
 }

10.) For and while loops are useful for when we need to iterate over code.

11.) A while loop is useful when we do not know how long we should be executing
the same block of code.

12.) Functions are blocks of code that have a specific task to do and returns the
result. We use these to keep our code DRY.

13.) One. You may send in as many values as you like, however only named parameters
will be useful.

14.) An array is a collection of data. It can hold an indeterminate amount of
data, however it will be limited by memory.

15.) T-diagrams are useful to be the developer console without using it. It is
an excellect tool for really understanding the code you write / read.

16.) You can comment out code with // for single lines of comments
or /* for a paragraph
      form such as
      this. */
